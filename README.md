# RazorGripProject

This project was built using Angular6, Angular Materials, And Bootstrap

## Run

Clone the repo and run 'npm install' to install dependencies.

Then run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.


## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Issues

Task 2: I am certain a better performant implementation is possible. I put most of my effort implementing this logic in a concise and readable way, the javascript style.
